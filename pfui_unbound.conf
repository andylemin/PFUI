    # Harden against out of zone rrsets, to avoid spoofing attempts.
    # Hardening queries multiple name servers for the same data to make
    # spoofing significantly harder and does not mandate dnssec.
    harden-glue: yes

    harden-large-queries: yes
    # Very large queries are ignored. Default is off, since it is legal protocol wise to send these, and could be
    # necessary for operation if TSIG or EDNS payload is very large. DNS Exfiltration uses loooong names..

    # Require DNSSEC data for trust-anchored zones, if such data is absent, the
    # zone becomes  bogus.  Harden against receiving dnssec-stripped data. If you
    # turn it off, failing to validate dnskey data for a trustanchor will trigger
    # insecure mode for that zone (like without a trustanchor).  Default on,
    # which insists on dnssec data for trust-anchored zones.

    # cause DNSSEC validation to additionally mark it as bogus.  Protects against

    # If nonzero, unwanted replies are not only reported in statistics, but also
    # a running total is kept per thread. If it reaches the threshold, a warning
    # is printed and a defensive action is taken, the cache is cleared to flush
    # potential poison out of it.  A suggested value is 10000000, the default is
    # 0 (turned off). We think 10K is a good value.
    unwanted-reply-threshold: 10000

    # IMPORTANT FOR TESTING: If you are testing and setup NSD or BIND  on
    # localhost you will want to allow the resolver to send queries to localhost.
    # Make sure to set do-not-query-localhost: yes . If yes, the above default
    # do-not-query-address entries are present.  if no, localhost can be queried
    # (for testing and debugging).

    # Should additional section of secure message also be kept clean of unsecure
    # data. Useful to shield the users of this validator from potential bogus

    # is removed from secure messages.
    val-clean-additional: yes

    minimal-responses: yes
    # If yes, Unbound doesn't insert authority/additional sections into response messages when those sections are not
    # required. This reduces response size significantly, and may avoid TCP fallback. May cause a slight speedup.

    qname-minimisation: yes
    # Send  minimum  amount  of  information  to  upstream  servers to enhance privacy.
    # Only send minimum required labels of the QNAME and  set  QTYPE  to  A when possible. Best effort approach; full
    # QNAME and original QTYPE will be sent when upstream replies with an  RCODE other than NOERROR, except when
    # receiving NXDOMAIN from a DNSSEC signed zone. Default is yes.

    qname-minimisation-strict: no
    # QNAME minimisation in strict mode. Do not fall-back  to  sending full QNAME to potentially broken nameservers.
    # A lot of domains will not be resolvable when this option in enabled. Only use if you know what you are doing.
    # This option only has effect when qname-minimisation is enabled. Default is off.

### BEGIN PERFORMANCE SECTION
    # perform prefetching of close to expired message cache entries.  If a client
    # requests the dns lookup and the TTL of the cached hostname is going to
    # expire in less than 10% of its TTL, unbound will (1st) return the ip of the
    # host to the client and (2nd) pre-fetch the dns request from the remote dns
    # server. This method has been shown to increase the amount of cached hits by
    # local clients by 10% on average.

    # memory as you use msg cache memory. Due to malloc overhead, the total memory
    # usage is likely to rise to double (or 2.5x) the total cache memory. The test
    # box has 4gig of ram so 256meg for rrset allows a lot of room for cacheed objects.
